# SA Mentor App

The purpose of this repo is to create a fullstack web application of a fake ecom store that we can use for training with Klaviyo's APIs in a semi realistic environment. We will use docker to create a local flask server and react client.

**To get started:**
1. pull the latest main - `git pull`
2. build local docker containers - `docker-compose build`
3. run local containers - `docker-compose up backend frontend`
    - This will spin up both containers and keep them running
